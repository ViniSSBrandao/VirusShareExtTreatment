## available tools

### File separator and counter `file_counter_separator.sh`
  
ðŸš€ Features

- Automatically detects file types using file --mime-type
- Moves files into corresponding folders named after their MIME type
- Creates a log file (registro_destino.csv) with records of processed files
- Displays progress and execution time

ðŸ“¥ Requisites & How to use:

- Must use a sh compatible enviroment (such as linux, macOS and wsl)
- The file command installed (default in most Linux distributions)
- Read, write, and execute permissions for the directories involved

- Make sure to edit the directories on your computer match the ones on the file<br/>
`source_dir="./Untreated_logs/` => the place where the analyzed files are stored before sorting <br/>
`dest_dir="./sample_classification` => the place where the analyzed files are stored before sorting<br/>
`log_file="registro_destino.csv` => the file with a log repoting what the files were classificated as <br/>

- To execute it, you can either call it from the terminal or make it executable. 

call it by using `sh file_counter_separator.sh` (or your os equivalent sh command) 

ðŸ“‚ Expected Output

If Untreated_logs/ contains:<br/>
- document.pdf<br/>
- image.jpg<br/>
- program.exe<br/>

The script creates:

    sample_classification/ 
    â”œâ”€â”€ application_pdf/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ document.pdf
    â”œâ”€â”€ image_jpeg/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ image.jpg
    â”œâ”€â”€ application_x-dosexec/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ program.exe
    ...

And their respective logs:

    File,           MIME_type,                 Destination Folder
    document.pdf,   application/pdf,           sample_classification/application_pdf
    image.jpg,      image/jpeg,                sample_classification/image_jpeg
    program.exe,    application/x-dosexec,     sample_classification/application_x-dosexec



## Count Aggregation `log_classification_and_separation.py`



ðŸš€ Features

- Load data: Reads the specified CSV files containing hash records and MIME types.
- Count MIME type occurrences: Aggregates the number of occurrences for each MIME type.
- Save MIME counts: Exports the MIME type count data to a CSV file.


Group and save records by MIME type: Organizes and saves separate CSV files containing records of each MIME type.

Print summary: Displays the MIME type count DataFrame.

ðŸ“¥ Requisites & How to use:

Python 3.x with pandas library installed is required

CSV files structured with a MIME_type column (on the path set on the file)

Set the block variable to specify the VirusShare package (or other pool of files) being processed.

Ensure the source CSV file exists at Untreated_logs/registro_destino_<block>.csv. (or personalize this to your particular use)

Run the script using your python interpreter to generate categorized logs and a summary CSV file.

ðŸ“‚ Expected Outputs

TypeCounts/mime_counts<block>.csv: Contains a count of each MIME type.

Separate CSV files in Logs_By_VirusShare/<block>/ categorized by MIME type.

Example Output:
        TypeCounts/Mime_counts004xx.csv: (will contain the counts for statistical analysis)

           MIME_type          Count  Virus_Share_Package
        application/pdf    150    Untreated_logs/registro_destino_00478.csv
        text/html          100    Untreated_logs/registro_destino_00478.csv
        ...
<br/>
        Logs_by_VirusShare/004xx/mime_type1.csv (each will contain the hashes for the files for reference and verification)<br/>
        Logs_by_VirusShare/004xx/mime_type2.csv  <br/>
        Logs_by_VirusShare/004xx/mime_type3.csv:

           MIME_type                                    Count               Virus_Share_Package
